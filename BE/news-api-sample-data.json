    "description": "John Krasinski has shared the set photos from the first day of shooting his prequel, A Quiet Place: Day One. The movie serves as a rewind to the first film in the A Quiet Place franchise. The first two films both jumped around a bit in the apocalypseâ€™s timeline; the first movie opens on Day 89 before jumping forward to detail the dramatic events of Day 472 and 473. Part II takes place in the days immediately after, but the film opens on Day 1.",
